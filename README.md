Hi, I’m @agustin-d-martinez

I’m interested in an electronic technician studying to be an electronic engineer.
I know specially about C, C++ and programing of embebed sistems.
I have some practive with Python, MatLAB, App creation with QtCreator and some Assembly.
I also know some description hardware with VHDL.

I’m looking to improve and put some of my code in use of future implementation.
